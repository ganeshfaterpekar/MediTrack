# AI Usage

This project made use of AI-assisted tools in a **supporting and assistive capacity** only.

---

## How AI Was Used

### Documentation
- Drafting and refining project documentation such as `README.md`
- Creating Architecture Decision Records (ADR) to clearly articulate design choices, trade-offs, and rationale

### Unit Testing
- Generating initial unit test scaffolding and mock implementations

### JSON Encoding / Decoding Utilities
- Assisting with the generation of reusable `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` configurations
- Handling ISO-8601 date formats, including fractional seconds
- Ensuring concurrency-safe decoding strategies aligned with Swift Concurrency best practices

---

## Summary

AI was used as a **developer productivity tool**, similar to documentation generators or code completion, while maintaining full ownership and accountability for the final design and implementation.
